Difference between a view and a pure function: A view function is a read-only function that will let one view a state variable, but will not let the function make any changes to the state variable. A pure function can not read a state variable, and also cannot modify a state variable.

Difference between a payable and non payable function: A function marked as "payable" allows ether to be transferred(sent) along with the logic of that function, while a non payable function cannot transfer ether.

Difference between constant data type and immutable data type: Both constant and immutable keywords are used to restrict changes to state variables, but while a constant variable is set at compile time, an immutable variable is set in the constructor during deployment.

Difference between a read function and a write function: A read function does not allow state modification, while a write function allows the state of the blockchain to be modified.
